# Kaatman-Bird
Flappy Bird in Python but with my teacher's head
## What is this?
Flappy Bird in Python but with my teacher's head
## Why did I create this?
Computer science project
## Why didn't I just make a text-based adventure game like everyone else?
I wanted to flex on everyone in my class. Definitely worth the 5 in-class days
## Why is there a lite and full version?
They're the same. I made it all work in 39 lines but the project requirement was to be at least 75 lines.
