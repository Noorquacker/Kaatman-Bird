## Why did I create this?
Computer science project

## Why didn't I just make a text-based adventure game like everyone else?
I wanted to flex on everyone in my class. Definitely worth the 5 in-class days

## Why is there a lite and full version?
They're the same. I made it all work in 39 lines but the project requirement was to be at least 75 lines.

## When was this made?
